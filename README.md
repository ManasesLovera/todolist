## Setup

You must have installed NPM and .NET Framework for running both frontend and backend.
1. Clone the repository

### Running backend

Just click on the start button in visual studio or type `dotnet run` in the terminal to run the backend.

### Running frontend

If you check the package.json I already have the angular cli for version 7 installed, since I have another angular version, so the first thing you must do is going to the frontend project `cd TodoListFrontend`, then `npm install` to get angular, bootstrap and all dependencies needed, and last but not least do `npm start` and your application should run and request the backend that is also running.
